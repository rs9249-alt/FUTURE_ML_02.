Supervised Machine Learning Projects: Titanic Survival &amp; Housing Price Prediction. This repository contains Task 2 of my internship, featuring a Classification model (Titanic) and a Regression model (California Housing) built using Scikit-Learn.
## Project 1: Titanic Survival Prediction (Classification)
* **Goal**: Predict whether a passenger survived based on features like Age, Sex, and Class.
* **Model**: Random Forest Classifier.
* **Key Metric**: Accuracy Score.

## Project 2: Housing Price Prediction (Regression)
* **Goal**: Predict median house values based on location and neighborhood features.
* **Model**: Linear Regression.
* **Key Metric**: R-Squared ($R^2$) Score and Residual Analysis.
